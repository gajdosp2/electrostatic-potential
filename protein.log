  | DelPhi Fortran program was originally developed in Barry Honig| 
  | lab to compute electrostatic potential and energies. The      | 
  | current C++ version is object oriented code, capable of       | 
  | performing the calculations in sequential, OpenMP and MPI     | 
  | regimes and the MPI version utilizes distributed memory       | 
  | technology. Particular novelty is the Gaussian-based smooth   | 
  | dielectric function that accounts for heterogeneity of the    | 
  | solute and solute-solvent interface.                          | 
  |                                                               |
